1) Draw a class hierarchy diagram to understand the base class / sub class relationships - 
2) What is the base class of the class you are inspecting ? 
3) If a variable to common to all processes make it as a protected variable. Do not just put it under private.
4) Getters should be const. If they are virtual and for derived classes do not forget to add the "override" keyword"
5) Think about exposing a function as public. Try to make it private by default.
