dynamic callstack in gdb
-------------------------

1) Attach to the process
(gdb) attach 17317

2) Show the location of the binary
(gdb) file /home/sgopal/a.out

3) Set pagination off so that we do not press <space> when the gdb is displaying continuous output.
(gdb) set pagination off

4) Break on your function.
(gdb) break  MyNameSpace::MySocketClass::Connect

5) Create a list of commands ("command list") using the "command"  keyword.
You can give any breakpoint (or watchpoint or catchpoint) a series of commands to execute when your program stops due to that breakpoint. For example, you might want to print the values of certain expressions, or enable other breakpoints.
(gdb) command

6) After breakpoint is hit, Show the backtrace when the MyNameSpace::MySocketClass::Connect is called. This maybe called from different places.
(gdb) backt

7) After showing backtrace, continue the execution.
(gdb) cont

8) End to specify the command list.
(gdb) end

9) Continue to continue execution of the program,
(gdb) c
